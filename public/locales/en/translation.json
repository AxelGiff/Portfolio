    "about_description": "From Paris to VsCode, I'm a professional web developer who likes coding any website, webapps with my personal UI/UX design touch. I have been studying front/back end since 2021. I've always been someone who has a taste for the creation and the logical side. That's why I've decided to become a front-end developer to use my power of my brain-skills.",
