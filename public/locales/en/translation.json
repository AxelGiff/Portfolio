  "Qualoto_description":"Qualoto is a web application developed at the end of 2024 as a university project that allows users to participate in a virtual lottery game. The game is designed to be accessible to all players, with an emphasis on development quality standards. The application is built using Django, a popular Python framework for creating Full Stack applications, along with other technologies such as Tailwind CSS and MySQL for the database. This project allowed me to adopt a conceptual approach, which helped me develop a deep understanding of the technologies used and better comprehend the different stages of web application development.",

  "Authentication_description":"At Qualoto, players begin by registering with a unique username. The system enforces strict validation—rejecting duplicates or empty entries (even those with only spaces) and returning descriptive error messages in JSON. Once registered, each player receives a ticket that records their draw participation, including draw date and chosen numbers, ensuring secure and traceable access throughout the game.",
  "Draw_title":"A drawing system with real players or bots",
  "Draw_description":"Qualoto features a dynamic drawing system where real players and randomized bots receive lottery numbers. When a draw is initiated, every participant is assigned a ticket containing their main and bonus numbers. A dedicated form lets players manually select their numbers or use a “Flash” option for random generation. The system then simulates the draw, ensuring fair assignment of numbers and adherence to the game’s strict rules.",
  "Ranking_title":"A ranking system with an equitable prize distribution algorithm",
  "Ranking_description":"After each lottery draw, Qualoto computes a ranking to identify the top winners. The ranking algorithm compares players’ tickets with the drawn numbers—regardless of order—and allocates prizes based on predefined percentage distributions (e.g., 40%, 20%, etc.). In cases where players share identical winning numbers, the system fairly splits the prize percentage between them, ensuring an equitable distribution of gains. This robust ranking process guarantees transparency and fairness in every draw.",
